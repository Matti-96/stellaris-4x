1. You can now only pick "Become The Crisis" if 50 game years have passed.
2. Federation cohesion has been modified to heavily penalize oposing ethics.
3. Market fee calculations have been modified to make market changes slower.
4. You can now no longer join or create a federation if you do not meet the ethics requirements.
5. Federations now have a size limit.
6. Made the crisis casus belli silent (no notification), and only active from crisis level 2. You can still see the casus beli from the diplomacy screen, so pay attention.
7. The crisis can already construct menacing corvettes from level 1. Hide them well so other players don't notice.
8. You can now trade relics under trade actions. Game icons have been altered to allow for easier localistaion.
9. Halved most of the galactic community timers, slightly reduced the cost for veto.
10. You can no longer trade relics if you have any relics activated (regardless of which relic is active).
11. Upgraded the fleet cap of federations to be 600 - 1200 - 3600 for low, medium and high fleet contribution respectively.
12. GDF now starts with size 400 and will upgrade to size 1000 upon expanding.
13. Authoritarian faction is no longer angry with Decadent Lifestyle living standards or any Assimilation citizenship type, but is no longer satisfied with robotic servitude if AI is outlawed.
14. Spiritualist faction is no longer angry with Robots Allowed if Roboticists are set to assemble cybernetic components.
15. Owning vassals and/or being in breach of galactic law no longer generates Menace passively. Steal Technology, Extort Favors, Spark Diplomatic Incident, and Smear Campaign espionage actions no longer generate Menace. Lowered the Menace gain from destroying ships by 66% and the Menace gain from destroying starbases by 33%. People who want to become the Crisis will need to go out and actively act like it.
16. Removed the cooldown from the Steal Technology espionage operation and increased the amount of tech progress stolen from 30% to 50%.
17. Worker Cooperative empires no longer get access to Consumer Benefits or Marketplace of Ideas. Mutual Aid now gives 0.4 Energy, 0.2 Food, and 0.2 Consumer Goods (from 0.3 Energy, 0.2 Food, and 0.2 Minerals) for non-Lithoids and Minerals instead of Food for Lithoids. Worker cooperative empires get special versions of the Trade League and Holy Covenant Trade Policies that give -0.3 Energy, +0.1 Food (Minerals if Lithoid), and +0.1 Consumer Goods compared to normal to replicate the effects of Mutual Aid.
