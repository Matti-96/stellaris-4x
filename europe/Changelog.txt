5. Federations now have a size limit.
6. Made the crisis casus belli silent (no notification), and only active from crisis level 2. You can still see the casus beli from the diplomacy screen, so pay attention.
7. The crisis can already construct menacing corvettes from level 1. Hide them well so other players don't notice.
8. You can now trade relics under trade actions. Game icons have been altered to allow for easier localistaion.

Mutual Aid now gives 0.4 Energy, 0.2 Food, and 0.2 Consumer Goods (from 0.3 Energy, 0.2 Food, and 0.2 Minerals) for non-Lithoids and Minerals instead of Food for Lithoids.
