1. You can now trade relics under trade actions. Game icons have been altered to allow for easier localistaion.
2. Market fee calculations have been modified to make market changes slower.
3. Federation cohesion has been modified to heavily penalize oposing ethics.
4. Halved most of the Galactic Community/Empire timers, slightly reduced the cost for veto.
5. Favors now do nothing in the Galactic Community.
6. You can now only pick "Become The Crisis" if 50 game years have passed.
7. Made the crisis casus belli silent (no notification), and only active from crisis level 2. You can still see the casus beli from the diplomacy screen, so pay attention.
8. The crisis can already construct menacing corvettes from level 1. Hide them well so other players don't notice.
9. Removed some game hints that directly tell you who is the crisis.
10. You can now no longer join or create a federation if you do not meet the ethics requirements.
11. Federations now have a size limit.

# 11. Upgraded the fleet cap of federations to be 600 - 1200 - 3600 for low, medium and high fleet contribution respectively.
# 12. GDF now starts with size 400 and will upgrade to size 1000 upon expanding.
# 13. Owning vassals and/or being in breach of galactic law no longer generates Menace passively. Steal Technology, Extort Favors, Spark Diplomatic Incident, and Smear Campaign espionage actions no longer generate Menace. Lowered the Menace gain from destroying ships by 66% and the Menace gain from destroying starbases by 33%. People who want to become the Crisis will need to go out and actively act like it.
# 14. Ship designer can now properly detect stealth roles regardless of what type of stealth tech a player has unlocked, and it can also now properly detect if the player has unlocked high-enough level stealth tech for stealth cruisers, battleships, and/or titans.
# 15. Doubled the naval capacity usage of corvettes, frigates, destroyers, cruisers, battleships, titans, menacing corvettes, menacing destroyers, and menacing cruisers.
# 17. Made it (functionally) impossible for a player to have more than two player vassals. Outside of a player vassalizing an AI and then having a player hotjoin as that AI, players should not longer be able to have more than two vassals who are players, including secret vassals from swearing secret fealties.
# 18. Diplomacy actions between players no longer need trust. Trust requirements for pacts with AI empires remain unchanged.
# 19. AI-Spawning origins have been disabled for players.
# 20. Broken Shackles has been tweaked so that it will no longer spawn MSI or a Payback empire unless another AI Broken Shackles and/or Payback empire already exists.
# 21. Defense in Depth now gives +15% Home Territory Ship Fire Rate instead of +10%, and it also now gives +50% Starbase Shield Hardening, +25% Defense Platform Shield Hardening, and +25% Defense Platform Armor Hardening.
# 22. For people who like to leave the ship auto-designer on, the auto-designer should now be less schizophrenic with its weapon choices.
# 23. Restricted Voting contract option for vassals no longer automatically invites them into the overlord's federation. This effect now only happens with the Limited Diplomacy option, and should make it easier for Hegemony federations to follow the rules around federation member limits. This change also includes a bug fix where all vassals would automatically join their overlord's federation the moment it passed the law to allow them in and/or upon initial vassalization if the overlord's federation allowed vassals in, regardless of what diplomacy contract option they had.
# 24. Halved the size of marauder raiding fleets, marauder mercenary fleets, fleets summoned by the Head of Zarqlan relic, and fleets summoned by the Summon Dimensional Fleet astral action to correspond to the doubled naval capacity cost of ships.
# 25. Favors are now forcibly disabled for Galactic Community/Empire votes. They can still be used for federation votes, as that use of favors is not banned by the rules.
# 26. Mutual Support now gives +40% Federation Delegate Cohesion Effect and +0.25 Federation Cohesion (+0.35 with the previous bonus) instead of +1 Favors and +5 Trust with empires whose proposed resolutions you have passed.
# 27. Slaves now always have lower priority for specialist-tier jobs than non-slaves, meaning if they are working a specialist-tier job while a non-slave worker- or specialist-tier pop is unemployed, they will unemploy themselves to make room for the unemployed non-slave pop. Among other things, this prevents weird situations where higher job attraction for indentured slaves leads to them being prioritized for jobs like Pearl Divers over non-slaves.
# 28. Hegemony federations no longer dissolve when their president is declared a crisis, and instead, all members of the Hegemony leave the Galactic Community/Empire with their president.
# 29. If the Great Khan is declared a crisis, all of their satrapy vassals are kicked out of the Galactic Community/Empire and cannot join unless they rebel against the Great Khan, until the Great Khan dies, or until the Great Khan is no longer declared a crisis by the Galactic Community/Empire. This mimics what happens when a player is declared a crisis.
# 30. To prevent certain bugs and exploits, empires will always get the special project to attempt to phase-lock The Veil if it is within their borders and can no longer use the option "We have better things to do."
# 31. The Space Amoeba Conservation Act no longer allows all empires to pacify amoebas, but now also acts in the same way that the Tiyanki Conservation Act does (i.e., you are in breach for 10 years if you kill a space amoeba fleet, as well as getting fined 1000 Energy).
# 32. Transferring the Tiyun Ort system to another player who had not surveyed it beforehand will now properly start the appropriate event chain to reveal its archaeological site if it had not been started before.
# 33. Fixed some issues related to planetary deposits modifiers not adding up.
