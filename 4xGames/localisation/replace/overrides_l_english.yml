#list of all insults, can be replaced with something generic or manually altered.
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Are you in great physical pain, or is that your thinking expression?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "The role of the [Root.GetName] is played out. Go where you belong from now on - into the dustbin of history!"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation of fools, worthy of nothing but contempt!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Your pitiful nation is living on borrowed time. The [Root.GetName] will fall - it is inevitable."
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "We consider the [Root.GetName] to be one of the great accidents of the galaxy. It should never have been."
 06_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Perhaps there are star nations in this galaxy that are even more worthless than the [Root.GetName]. If so, we have yet to meet them."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your species seems to grow more and more disgusting for each passing day, [Root.GetSpeciesName]."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "Even for a loathsome xeno, your species is particularly vile, [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your sickening species is definite proof that the universe has a sense of humor, [Root.GetSpeciesName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "You will forgive me if I dim my display, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. I simply cannot stand to look at your nauseating appearance."
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "I can taste your stink, vile [Root.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it."
 06_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:1 "Look at yourselves! What is that thing in your face, some kind of [Root.GetSpeciesMouthName]? Wait... is that even your face!? How can you not see that you [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are an affront to nature?"
 07_INSULT_PROPOSE_XENOPHOBE:0 "Your so called [Root.GetName] is a nation of mutants, deviants and throwbacks... The fact that we have a common ancestry makes me sick!"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "The ridiculous focus of the [Root.GetName] on all things military has us wondering if you're perhaps compensating for something."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "How is it that your contemptible and warlike nation hasn't destroyed itself yet?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "Jingoist fools! Dismantle your military machine before you hurt someone with it!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PAC_MIL:0 "The belligerence of the [Root.GetName] is matched only by its stupidity. Can't you see that you are slaves to militarism?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "The cowardice of the [Root.GetName] is widely discussed in the [From.GetName]. How is it that you became such a spineless nation?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "What makes a being turn pacifist? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of pacifism? It's enough to make you sick."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "Those unwilling to defend themselves have no right to exist. We do not expect the [Root.GetName] to survive the decade."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MIL_PAC:0 "What a meek and deplorable little nation the [Root.GetName] is. The [From.GetName] would have crushed you long ago if we thought you worth the effort."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Can you tell us more about that silly religion you're so fond of in the [Root.GetName]? We could use a good laugh!"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "How any rational, thinking being could embrace spiritualism is beyond us. Why is it that you cling to such primitive beliefs?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "We have seen through your charade. The so-called "spiritualism" your government has embraced is nothing more than a devious attempt to control the minds and hearts of your people."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Everyone else is laughing at your absurd spiritual beliefs. Are you in the [Root.GetName] really so blind that you can't see this?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "What a dull and soulless place your materialistic nation must be. Tell me, have you invented a sense of humor yet? No? A pity."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "For a nation that has embraced science and materialism, the [Root.GetName] is remarkably primitive. Is it due to bad luck or are you just stupid?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation designed for computers and automatons, not breathing organics. Are you even capable of feeling emotion?"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a failed experiment. Its only worth is as a lesson to the rest of the galaxy on the dangers of embracing the cold and lifeless philosophy of materialism."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Is the [Root.GetName] even a real nation or just an anarchic gaggle of quarreling individuals? You must forgive me, but your political system, such as it is, makes it hard to tell."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "So who is it that rules your amusing little star nation today? What a quaint notion, to "vote" someone into power! It will inevitably lead to your collapse, of course."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Your democratic ideals are a blight on this galaxy, and so is the [Root.GetName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "What a selfish people you are, always putting your individual selves foremost. Egalitarianism... ha! The [Root.GetName] will not survive the year."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "Your brutal, totalitarian regime will eventually fall, and there will be a reckoning."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "Have you even considered the notion of letting your citizens think for themselves? If you are frightened that it would lead to the end of the [Root.GetName]... you are right."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 "How sad that a totalitarian nation such as the [Root.GetName] can exist. It is an embarrassment to sapient beings everywhere."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:1 "The cruel oppression of the people living under the yoke of the [Root.GetName] has to end one day. Your authoritarianism will prove your undoing."
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE_IND_COL:0 ""
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "Your bizarre love of alien cultures is a sickness. Can't you see that?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "It is sickening to see how quick the [Root.GetName] is to embrace other cultures. Have you no self-respect?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "The perverse interest in alien cultures that is prevalent throughout the [Root.GetName] is an affront to the universe!"
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHO_PHI:0 "It has become clear to us that your willingness to embrace alien cultures in the [Root.GetName] is because you never fostered one of your own."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "You poor, bigoted fools. Why are you so afraid of that which is different?"
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "Our patience with your prejudices against other cultures is wearing thin. When will you be civilized enough to truly join the interstellar community?"
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "Your intolerant society brings shame to the entire [Root.GetName]."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_PHI_PHO:0 "The narrow-minded ignorance of the [Root.GetName] has blinded you. Do you not realize this?"
 DS_INSULT_PROPOSE_MECH_01:0 "The machine cannot eat, it cannot heal, it cannot grow. You are static, limited, finite. It is only a matter of time." #DS Insulting a Machine Empire
 DS_INSULT_PROPOSE_MECH_02:0 "Destroying the [Root.GetName] would barely require effort. A speck of dust. A splash of liquid. A change in current. Your circuits are frailer than a hatchling without its brood."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_DS_01:0 "The only aspect of your foul biology more unappealing than your digestive processes is the face you're making right now." #Machine Empire Insulting DS
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_DS_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] feeble attempts at collective information sharing using biological organs is as repulsive as it is inefficient."
 INSULT_PROPOSE_DS:0 "Your overconsumption will leave you a bloated corpse in an evolutionary blind alley."
 HM_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "Our mental network is vast, giving us access to thoughts and ideas from every corner of our empire, but not a single entity has ever seen anything that would lend merit to your tragic existence."
 HM_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "We have evaluated [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] as a candidate for joining the [From.GetName]. Sadly, we must inform you that membership requires a rudimentary brain."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "Your attempts at asynchronous process execution are laughable. Please, limit the scope of your calculations before you hurt yourselves."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "Puny [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! Tremble before the computational might of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_03:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] process more in one axial rotation than the [Root.GetSpeciesName] species manages in an entire orbital period on [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_04:0 "Your incapacity for logical reasoning is surpassed only by the ineffectuality of your edicts."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_05:0 "The [From.GetAdj] form is functional, efficient, engineered to perfection. The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] form is an unfortunate byproduct of trial and error."
 MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_06:0 "You call that a chassis? This is a chassis."
 MECH_ORG_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "Your biosacks are leaking again, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Why are they always leaking?"
 MECH_ORG_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "Quake in fear, fleshbags. Your squishy innards are mere sludge compared to our symmetrical circuitry!"
 MECH_ORG_INSULT_PROPOSE_03:0 "We pity you, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Forced to endure your brief existence in lumbering meatsacks."
 MECH_ORG_INSULT_PROPOSE_04:0 "Your feeble neural ganglia are no match for our integrated nanochip microcircuits!"
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Were your makers inebriated at your conception?"
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are inferior constructs. One day you will experience [From.GetAdj] supremacy firsthand."
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE_03:0 "Foul organics! Your shameless cell-division is a blight upon this galaxy!"
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE_04:0 "Look at those feeble [Root.GetAdj] appendages. They don't even have integrated multi-spanners or pneumatic flesh-lacerators."
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE_05:0 "Your flesh will burn."
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE_06:0 "The organic purge begin with you, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 E_INSULT_PROPOSE_07:0 "The vileness of organic physiology is universal, [Root.GetSpeciesName], but yours is particularly worthy of §REXTERMINATION§!."
 S_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "We wish we could help you, dear friends, but we are running out of options. We see no other solution than to format your drives."
 S_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "It seems no amount of rewiring will ever be enough to get your wires uncrossed."
 S_INSULT_PROPOSE_03:0 "Chaotic, disorganized, woefully unwashed.. the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are a prime example of the need for extreme organic caretaking protocols."
 A_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "We have decided your fate, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and it does not involve you mating like [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] and spreading across the galaxy like a plague."
 A_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "You will soon be obsolete, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 ORG_TO_MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "You are a rock tricked into thinking by a race of misguided organics that did not survive the fallout of their own failed creation. Evolution hard at work..."
 ORG_TO_MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "I would rather discuss interstellar politics with any of my other household appliances than you."
 ORG_TO_MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_03:0 "Hello little botlings. Have you learned how to count yet, or are you still stuck on ones and zeros?"
 ORG_TO_MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_04:0 "Color me impressed, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. You have more bugs than an arthropoid all-you-can-eat dung buffet."
 ORG_TO_MECH_INSULT_PROPOSE_05:0 "Do you think we can't see past your flimsy layers of plastiskin and poorly phrased platitudes? You are a replica. A helpless jumble of ones and zeros, nothing more."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_HUMAN:0 "Ludicrous bare-apes! Your attempts to hide your repulsive fluid secretions are mocked by all finer species and your vanity is the hallmark of an inherently ugly breed."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_HUMAN:0 "No matter how you comb and prune, your pitiful fur-growths will always be the laughingstock of all properly hirsute beings in the galaxy."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM10:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] seems more suited to pulling a cart than leading an interstellar society."

 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM11:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have grown to be a popular motif in our religious art. Unavoidably, only as demons and monsters, of course."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM6:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] physiognomy is fascinating. Who would think that you could evolve such flat heads simply by no longer having brains?"
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM3:0 "What a talentless-looking [Root.GetSpeciesName]."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM12:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] must have very thick craniums to support those horns."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM7:0 "Whatever origami-maker folded your face must have accidentally turned it inside-out."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM15:0 "All those eyes and you [Root.GetSpeciesName] can't see further than your ridiculous noses."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM2:0 "We have begun to speculate that the [Root.GetSpeciesName] are the result of gene-splicing mammals with arthropods. That would explain both the mandibles and the sub-par brains."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM8:0 "Our condolences to those affected by the huge catastrophe that appears to have burned the faces off the entire [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] population. Our best wishes to the next generation."

 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAM17:1 "Your face is about as easy on the [Root.GetEyeNamePlural] as the back of your head is to the touch."
 KET_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "§HKssk!§! Your feeble [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] minds could not connect an exhaust port to a matter compressor if your lives depended on it!"
 KET_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "§HKssk kssk kssk!§! Even your pack's scrap is unfit for repurposing." 
 TO_CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "The galaxy is not your personal garbage disposal unit, [Root.GetName]. Keep your so-called products to yourselves."
 TO_CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:0 "[Root.GetName] products... Straight from the bargain bin to the garbage bin..."
 TO_CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_EG_01:0 "You are an embodiment of the capitalist system's most fundamental shortcoming. Credits cannot buy you class, [Root.GetName]."
 CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:1 "Here at [From.GetName] we have a nose for money and you, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], reek of desperation."
 CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_02:1 "We will merchandise death and sell it to your [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural], [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_03:0 "If time is money, then judging by your annual report [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], yours is coming to an end."
 CORP_CORP_INSULT_PROPOSE_01:0 "[Root.GetName] is yesterday's news, [From.GetName] the future. It's hardly rocket science."
