1. You can now trade relics under trade actions. Game icons have been altered to allow for easier localistaion.
2. Market fee calculations have been modified to make market changes slower.
3. Federation cohesion has been modified to heavily penalize oposing ethics.
4. Halved most of the Galactic Community/Empire timers, slightly reduced the cost for veto.
5. Favors now do nothing in the Galactic Community.
6. You can now only pick "Become The Crisis" if 50 game years have passed.
7. Made the crisis casus belli silent (no notification), and only active from crisis level 2. You can still see the casus beli from the diplomacy screen, so pay attention.
8. The crisis can already construct menacing corvettes from level 1. Hide them well so other players don't notice.
9. Removed some game hints that directly tell you who is the crisis.
10. You can now no longer join or create a federation if you do not meet the ethics requirements.
11. Federations now have a size limit.
12. Upgraded the fleet cap of federations to be 600 - 1200 - 3600 for low, medium and high fleet contribution respectively.
13. Made it (functionally) impossible for a player to have more than two player vassals. Outside of a player vassalizing an AI and then having a player hotjoin as that AI, players should not longer be able to have more than two vassals who are players, including secret vassals from swearing secret fealties.
14. Diplomacy actions between players no longer need trust. Trust requirements for pacts with AI empires remain unchanged.
15. AI-Spawning origins have been disabled for players.
16. Favors are now forcibly disabled for Galactic Community/Empire votes. They can still be used for federation votes, as that use of favors is not banned by the rules.
17. Owning vassals and/or being in breach of galactic law no longer generates Menace passively. Steal Technology, Extort Favors, Spark Diplomatic Incident, and Smear Campaign espionage actions no longer generate Menace. Lowered the Menace gain from destroying ships by 66% and the Menace gain from destroying starbases by 33%. People who want to become the Crisis will need to go out and actively act like it.
18. Transferring the Tiyun Ort system to another player who had not surveyed it beforehand will now properly start the appropriate event chain to reveal its archaeological site if it had not been started before.
19. Mutual Support now gives +40% Federation Delegate Cohesion Effect and +0.25 Federation Cohesion (+0.35 with the previous bonus) instead of +1 Favors and +5 Trust with empires whose proposed resolutions you have passed.
20. To prevent certain bugs and exploits, empires will always get the special project to attempt to phase-lock The Veil if it is within their borders and can no longer use the option "We have better things to do."
21. Hegemony federations no longer dissolve when their president is declared a crisis, and instead, all members of the Hegemony leave the Galactic Community/Empire with their president.
22. If the Great Khan is declared a crisis, all of their satrapy vassals are kicked out of the Galactic Community/Empire and cannot join unless they rebel against the Great Khan, until the Great Khan dies, or until the Great Khan is no longer declared a crisis by the Galactic Community/Empire. This mimics what happens when a player is declared a crisis.
23. GDF now starts with size 400 and will upgrade to size 1000 upon expanding.
24. Slaves now always have lower priority for specialist-tier jobs than non-slaves, meaning if they are working a specialist-tier job while a non-slave worker- or specialist-tier pop is unemployed, they will unemploy themselves to make room for the unemployed non-slave pop. Among other things, this prevents weird situations where higher job attraction for indentured slaves leads to them being prioritized for jobs like Pearl Divers over non-slaves.

# 33. Fixed some issues related to planetary deposits modifiers not adding up.
